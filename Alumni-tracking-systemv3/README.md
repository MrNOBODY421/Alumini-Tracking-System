# Alumini-Tracking-System
Alumini Tracking System
( Currently there is no mechanism for colleges to keep a track of students passed out. Hence the problem is to develop a web based application for colleges to keep a track of Alumini )

The web based application will have the following features â€“
1.	Allow alumini members to register themselves.
2.	Allow colleges to verify & authenticate their registered alumini.
3.	Provision for alumini members to update their details
4.	Allow colleges to search details based on criteria such as year, subject, etc
5.	Send messages and emails to alumini members
6.	Group chats, create events, publish notices on the portal
7.	Security features with login for every user.

Technologies to be used : AngularJS, HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL

The project is to be developed under Mobility Development Tech Camp organised by IncubateInd. 

Team 17 under the guidance of mentor Karan Ludhani (Web Developer)
